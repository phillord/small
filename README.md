# Small

This is a Clojure library that provides fast implementations for small data
structures. Data structures are, like Clojure, immutable. They do structural
sharing though. In all cases, they have linear performance, but normally
faster than Clojure constant time performance.

I am writing this because I am trying to work out how all the Clojure
interfaces (and there are lots) actually work. It's not a serious project at
the moment.

## Usage

I said it wasn't a serious project.

## Performance

See the project small-benchmark.
